\* On Sailesforce chatbot, every intent must have at least 20 variations to turn AI and Semantic Engine On. The recomended amount is 200 variations per intention. This representas a lot of effort. 

¹ Needs to buy Tableau CRM with Einstein Bots, then you can view the EinsteinBotsV2 Dashboard by visiting the Analytics Studio app in the App Launcher and finally view the reports.

² Einstein Bots have a poor default semantic set, that means if are including new custom intentions, you will need to manually update your KB and re-training the model to link the new intentions, event for simple conversation flows (https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/221923/einstein-bots-training). If you train the model again this will require a new test and deployment flow.

³ It needs Service Cloud and Live Agent Licenses, these are provided by a SalesForce partner. If you stop using SalesForce you lose the entire ChatBot content. It means all services and countries must be using SalesForce as CRM. Some tasks as creating new forms, getting user information, define logical conversation flow needs a SalesForce expert do assist the process.

The purpose of this new Einstein feature is to allow customers and partners to create intelligent bot agents which can serve as the first line of support in helping customers with simple but essential service inquiries. These inquiries can include providing the status of an order, updating an appointment, canceling a reservation or initiating a field service request.

If you need a richier, multi-purpose and highly humanized AI, it can become a pain to do it using Einstein Bots, cause its simply not intended for that. Another importante point to consider: if you pay for sessions on a common chatbot, may you be happy to cut off this coast, but you can ending moving it to another place: maintainement, support and development.
